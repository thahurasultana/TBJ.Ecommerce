                TBJ Electronics is a British electrical retailer operating
                in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, owned by TBJ plc and selling
                home electronics and home appliances.
            </p>
            <p class="handwriting">
                Established in 1980, TBJ Electronics expanded the range of goods sold and from the 1920s
                became a major retailer of household electrical items.
            </p>

            <p class="handwriting">
                In 1990 the company was bought by rival retailer Dixons,
                and the TBJ's' brand was used for all outlets of the combined company.
            </p>
            <p class="handwriting">
                From 2008, the business turned away from shops in town centres to
                larger out-of-town stores under the TBJ Electronics World brand,
                combining the operations of TBJ with Dixon's PC World under one roof;
                after the formation of Dixons Carphone in 2014,
                the stores gained Carphone Warehouse departments.
                By October 2021, all outlets rebranded as TBJ.
